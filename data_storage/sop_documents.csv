Collar Installation for LI-COR 8200 Smart Chamber SOP,Collar Installation for LI-COR 8200 Smart Chamber,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13737988,https://zenodo.org/records/13737989/files/TLI_PLP_13737988_collar_installation_for_LI-COR_8200_smart_chamber_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"This procedure describes the dimensions and installation of soil collars used to measure soil gas fluxes with the LI-COR LI-7820 analyzer and the 8200 smart chamber combo. The scope of this procedure is limited to the installation of the collars work with a LI-COR 8200 smart chamber. The positioning of collars within the field is experiment-specific, therefore was not covered in this procedure.",
Data Extraction From LI-COR LI-7820 SOP,Data Extraction From LI-COR LI-7820,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13737961,https://zenodo.org/records/13737962/files/TLI_PLP_13737961_data_extraction_from_LI-COR_LI-7820_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,The purpose of this procedure is to standardize the format of the data being extracted from a LI-COR LI-7820 gas analyzer for unified data analysis. This SOP is limited to the LI-COR Li-7820 device being used for the FABPGC grant. This specific output format is required to organize the database for the data being collected across every location/experimental plot. This does not apply to any other intended uses of the LI-COR analyzer data.,
LI-COR LI-7820 Gas Analyzer and Smart Chamber SOP,LI-COR LI-7820 Gas Analyzer and Smart Chamber,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13737844,https://zenodo.org/records/13737845/files/TLI_PLP_13737844_LI-COR_LI-7820_analyzer_and_smart_chamber_combination_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"The purpose of this procedure is to explain how to measure greenhouse gas emissions using the Li-Cor 7820 trace gas analyzer and the 8200 smart chamber combo. Pre-installed soil collars are used to take point measurements of soil N2O emissions, soil water content and temperature, and other soil dynamics. The 8200 smart chamberâ€™s wireless hotspot and software allows taking measurements in real-time. The scope of this procedure is limited to the usage of a Li-Cor LI-7820 combined with a 8200 smart chamber. All materials and methods specifically are used for this setup. If other devices are used to substitute the necessary materials, do not refer to this SOP.",
Maize Stand Count SOP,Maize Stand Count,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13738096,https://zenodo.org/records/13738097/files/TLI_PLP_13738096_Maize_Stand_Count_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"To determine the number of maize plants per unit area, assessing crop establishment and potential yield. This SOP outlines how to assess maize plant count for evaluating crop establishment and potential yield. It includes measuring and counting plants in designated rows, noting health and spacing, and calculating plant density and storing the gathered data in databases for extended use over time.",
PGC Establishement SOP,PGC Establishement,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13738069,https://zenodo.org/records/13738070/files/TLI_PLP_13738069_PGC%20establishment_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"This document outlines the methods and best practices for the establishment of PGC in breeding, agronomy, or other PGC field trials. PGC establishment is a critical first step in conducting a successful PGC trial or experiment. This SOP outlines some suggested methods and best practices for PGC establishment; however, the plot widths, field prep, equipment availability at certain locations may necessitate deviations from this SOP. Tips and troubleshooting suggestions are provided.",
PGC Grass Suppression Visual Rating Scale SOP,PGC Grass Suppression Visual Rating Scale,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13738133,https://zenodo.org/records/13738134/files/TLI_PLP_13738133_PGC_grass_suppression_visual_rating_scale_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"The purpose of this procedure is to establish a reliable visual scale of the degree of suppression of PGC grass that has received a suppression treatment or is physiologically dormant. This scale specifically addresses the visual appearance of PGC grasses subjected to suppression treatment within PGC system field trials and on-farm trials. This same rating scale could be extended to include physiologically induced PGC dormancy. This does not include specific sampling methods used when taking multiple measurements per plot, or when using a sampling quadrat, but only covers how to take the measurements once a sample has been chosen.",
PGC Plot Image Acquisition SOP,PGC Plot Image Acquisition,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8428810,https://zenodo.org/records/8428811/files/TLI_PLP_8428810_PGC_plot_image_acquisition_SOP.pdf?download=1,0.1.0,"The purpose of this procedure is to explain and standardize PGC plot image acquisition using the GridScore progressive web app. These setups allow data to be collected, marked and stored easily. The scope of this procedure is limited to using smartphones with the GridScore app for PGC plot imaging. The imaging is scoped to the acquisition of images in plots that have ROIs demarcated either by blue landscaping fabric stakes or a PVC quadrat. Sampling strategies in a plot and image acquisition frequency are outside the scope of this document.",
